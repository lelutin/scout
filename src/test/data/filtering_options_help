    Filter notes by different criteria.

    -b BOOK             %(action)s notes belonging to specified notebooks. It is a
                        shortcut to option "-t" to specify notebooks more
                        easily. For example, use "-b HGTTG" instead of "-t
                        system:notebook:HGTTG". Use this option once for each
                        desired book.
    -B                  %(action)s notes that are not part of any books.
    -t TAG              %(action)s notes with specified tags. Use this option once
                        for each desired tag. This option selects raw tags and
                        could be useful for user-assigned tags.
    -T                  %(action)s notes with no tags.
    --with-templates    Include template notes. This option is different from
                        using "-t system:template" in that the latter used
                        alone will only include the templates, while using "--
                        with-templates" without specifying tags for selection
                        will include all notes and templates.
